PROBLEM STATEMENT

With online sales gaining popularity, tech companies are exploring ways to improve their sales by analysing customer behaviour and gaining insights about product trends. Furthermore, the websites make it easier for customers to find the products they require without much scavenging. This is done by tracking your clicks on their website and searching for patterns within them. This kind of data is called a clickstream data.
